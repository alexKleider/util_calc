Pacific Gas and Electric Schedule E-1, Residential Services

Along the coast we live in Zone "T" for which the "base line" "B"
(for 'basic') (E6/E1) usage in kWh/day is:
    Summer (May...Oct)  7.0  14.0  21.0
    Winter (Nov...Apr)  8.5  17.0  25.5

The cost per kWh for up to the base line usage is  $0.18212/kWh
From base line to twice base line usage cost is    $0.25444/kWh
Usage in excess of two times base line costs     $0.37442/kWh

1 cubic foot propane = 0.0278 gallons propane
Therefore cost of a cubic foot of propane is 0.0278 x price per gal.

Currently (as of March, 2016) propane is $4.079/gal == $0.1134/cu-ft.


Meter Readings
==============

The initial readings have been done March 19th, 2016 and the intent
is to read the meters **on or close to the first** of each month
beginning May, 2016.   
** Ammended to "towards the end".

See file readings.csv.
