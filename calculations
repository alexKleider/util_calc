Utility cost calculation methodology
(These are updated rates (electricity only) as of Mar 2018.)
{{ New rates as of before November 2019 }}

Electricity
===========

From:

Pacific Gas and Electric Schedule E-1, Residential Services

Along the coast we live in Zone "T" for which the "base line" "B"
(for 'basic') (E6/E1) usage in kWh/day is shown in the first column:
    Summer (May...Oct)  7.0  14.0  21.0
    Winter (Nov...Apr)  8.5  17.0  25.5

{{  Summer (Jun...Sep)  6.8   x2    x3  [1]  }}
{{  Winter (Oct...May)  8.2   x2    x3       }}

The cost per kWh for up to the base line usage is $0.20078/kWh {{0.22981}}
From base line to twice base line usage cost is   $0.27748/kWh {{0.28920}}
Usage in excess of two times base line costs      $0.40337/kWh {{0.50667}}


Propane
=======

Meter reads in cubic feet.

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj9xIeC-83LAhUG92MKHWOEBBIQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edcgov.us%2FGovernment%2FAg%2FPropane_Conversion_Chart.aspx&usg=AFQjCNFSq8UUvwTExkGq_4SSyQmdszDKbA&sig2=3z3bhV6tNB_VVqRHZZGBrw

1 cubic foot propane = 0.0278 gallons propane
Therefore cost of a cubic foot of propane is 0.0278 x price per gal.

Price of propane varies with each delivery: with Amerigas it's been
circa $5.00/gal but we expect it to drop to ~3.40 with the new (McPhail)
supplier.


Meter Readings
==============

I'll do an initial reading of the meters when you begin moving in or
just before we leave on the 29th (March 2018,) which ever comes first.

See file readings.csv.
